= Matchmaking - a Spring Boot 4.0 demo

== Running the application
You need Java 25 and Docker Compose.

Start the OpenTelemetry backend with the usual command:

[source,shell]
----
$ docker compose up -d
----

You then need to start the player backend any way you fancy.
The easiest is as follows:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./gradlew :playerprofile:bootRun
----

Finally, the main `matchmaking` application can be started.
You can do so in your IDE (run `io.spring.sample.matchmaking.Application`) or using the command-line as follows:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./gradlew :matchmaking:bootRun
----

You can then open `http://localhost:8080`.

== Using the application

A number of scripts are available.
You can queue players to start seeing them on the home page as follows:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./queue.sh 50
----

See `requests.http` for more query you can run against the service.

To see what's exported to the OpenTelemetry backend, browse to `http://localhost:3000`.
The default credentials are `admin`/ `admin`.
